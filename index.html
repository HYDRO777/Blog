                        <p class="p_modal">Fortnite is an online video game developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative hybrid-tower defense-shooter-survival game for up to four players to fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with traps and fortifications they can build; Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game in which up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; and Fortnite Creative, in which players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas. Save the World and Battle Royale were released in 2017 as early access titles, while Creative was released on December 6, 2018. Save the World is available only for Windows, macOS,[b] PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, while Battle Royale and Creative released for all those platforms, and also for Nintendo Switch, iOS,[b] and Android devices.[b] The game is expected to also launch with the release of the next-generation PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles.

                            While the Save the World and Creative versions have been successful for Epic Games, Fortnite Battle Royale in particular became a resounding success – drawing in more than 125 million players in less than a year, earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month, and becoming a cultural phenomenon.<br> <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home" target="_blank"><b>Fortnite Official Website</b></a> </p>

            <p>Sonic the Hedgehog[b] is a 2020 action-adventure comedy film based on the Sonic video game franchise published by Sega. The film is directed by Jeff Fowler (in his feature directorial debut) and written by Pat Casey and Josh Miller. It stars Ben Schwartz as the voice of Sonic the Hedgehog and Jim Carrey as Doctor Robotnik, as well as James Marsden and Tika Sumpter. In the film, Sonic teams up with local town sheriff Tom Wachowski to find his lost rings and escape Dr. Robotnik.

                Development for a film began in the 1990s but did not go beyond the planning stage until Sony Pictures acquired the film rights in 2013. Production involved the collaboration of Sega Sammy's Japanese studio Marza Animation Planet, with Fowler brought in to direct in 2016. After Sony put the project in turnaround, Paramount Pictures acquired it in 2017. The majority of the cast signed on by August 2018, and principal filming took place between September and October that year in Vancouver and on Vancouver Island. Following the negative reaction to the first trailer in 2019, the film's release was delayed by three months to redesign Sonic.

                Sonic the Hedgehog premiered at the Paramount Pictures studio lot on January 25, 2020, and was theatrically released in the United States on February 14, 2020. Critics praised the performances (particularly that of Schwartz and Carrey), Sonic's character design and animation, visual effects, action scenes, and its faithfulness to the source material, but criticized its story for its perceived lack of originality.[11][12] The film set the record for the biggest opening weekend for a video game film in the United States and Canada. It grossed $313 million worldwide, becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2020 and the highest-grossing video game film adaptation of all time in North America. A sequel is scheduled to be released in 2022. (By wikiepedia)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(film))</p>

            </h5>
            <p>Modern Family is primarily a comedy that revolves around three families that are held together more by their virtue of acceptance and love than by the blood ties that connect them. Each character has been thoughtfully written out and played to perfection by a slew of actors who take your breath away. A family that is so imperfectly perfect that you draw the expectations for your own family - present or future - from their actions, morals, decisions and values.

                It's a show where an old rich man marries a young woman of colour; where a white patriarchal figure accepts, not without his reservations, his openly gay son and his partner; where a gay couple gets its chance at parenting when they adopt an Asian girl; where we have a teenage pregnancy create the foundations of a loving family; where an old couple decides to give parenting a spin in the second innings of their life; where each child grows up emboldened with the confidence that his family is there to support him/her to become their own person.

                What the show does impeccably well is throw societal expectations for a toss to underline only one thing - who we are and choose to be does not dictate the rightness or the wrongness of our being. The only this that does is the purity of our hearts. That is it. One episode after the other, we have the writers create interwoven and hilarious narratives into episodes that break stereotypes and societal conventions to showcase the meaningless of their existence.

                Despite the seriousness of the central theme, the show is outright hilarious. It is witty - much too witty to understand every joke, every emotion, every retort in just one watch. The writing is spot on. It makes you live the characters and fall in love with each one of them - one episode at a time. It's made me pause the show because I had to laugh so bad. It has also made me pause to make way for a few tears which flowed without announcement, without purpose. The families, despite their eccentricities and unconventional way of being, are ever so relatable in how they love one another. The only way to truly love someone is to let them thrive in their own choices - that's what I learn from this show - every day.

                It's unparalleled what this show has done for the people who were too scared to come out of their closets and the parents who were too scared to have a kid who did. I cannot recommend this show enough. You will feel a myriad of emotions when you truly embrace the depth of the stories and therein lies its beauty.(Reviews from IMDB by Sakshatjain)(https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1442437/reviews)</p>

            <p>Naruto the starter series is better for me than the shippuden. I used to admire ninjas and naruto was an awesome anime featuring the ninjas.

                In fact, I actually watched naruto shippuden first(not the complete series, just until the sasuke itachi fight) and only then I realised that my friends, the so called naruto fans had been bragging about watching part two without watching the beginning, which I did too as they gave me the downloaded videos.

                But as soon as I realized there is something more to it, I soon switched to manga and it was possibly my best transition. Manga gave the story a lot more feelings, the art just gives me goosebumps as I have always been a fan of good art. The drawing is so captivating and the emotions are so powerful in the manga.

                Here are the reasons why I prefer part one over two:

                The term ninja had more meaning in part one, with their stealth, shuriken and traps, but in shippuden, they are just people who manipulate chakra and bring out visually feasting ninjutsu. Like bruce wayne suddenly decide to go iron man instead of batman one day(I totally love these 2 characters, but I was just pointing out the difference to get the clear picture).
                The characters are not overpowered in part 1. The second hokage was kind of the only person who could make water out of nowhere. But somehow in part 2, everyone had a boost in chakra reserves.
                The elders are respected. The sannin, lord third and kakashi were given special emphasis and the respect towards them by other ninja and even the author was evident. But these did not last in part 2. Tsunade has hardly had a fight, Orochimaru was killed multiple times and humiliated during the entire series. Kakashi became a forgotten legend.
                The author decided to go with fans on the rest of the story. Byakugan was awesome in part 1 but sharingan became everything in part 2.
                I wanna become the hokage became a mere forgotten catch phrase. And the centre of series became sasuke. And sasuke changed so much, with his arrogance which for for some reason isn’t cool at all, in fact was a disaster.
                The monsters of chunin exams, lee, neji, kankuro, temari etc were neglected.
                Rasengan and chidori used to be one time attacks due to chakra limits and due to their awesomeness as finishing blows. But in part 2, hundreds of shadow clones run around with rasengans without hitting anything. Sasuke and kakashi usually begin with chidori.
                Gamambunta reduced greatly in size and also, is not getting the respect it used to get. Same would go for manda.
                9 tails was over powered. Remember how much chakra naruto gave to shinobi in war in addition to fighting multiple tailed beasts.
                Plot holes and plot armour were much more in part 2.
                The story towards the end was not planned beforehand by the author and the author lost control by the war. The so called twists were in fact new even to the author. There was no foreshadowing about anything. And most importantly, where did the becoming hokage go. I thought it was supposed to be the central theme of the manga.
                I kind of enjoyed everything upto pain arc. But the war saga and the new characters were all tiring. There was no character development nor world building. The kinkaku brothers were the worst for me. And trying to use our nostalgia and sentiment in part 1 by bringing up old scenes and flashbacks was, for me, a vague attempt at trying to use our sentiment. And neji being an insignificant character throughout part 2 made me feel nothing when died.

                Mangas change their nature over years as the authors themselves age and their thoughts change, but even giving that consideration, I would point out naruto shippuden as a tragedy of ruining a legendary series.(Reviw from Quora by Deva Dathan) (https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-review-of-Naruto-Naruto-Shippuden) </p>

            </h5>
            <p>One of the best shows I've ever seen, this series has it all: countless surprising plot twists, humor, long satisfying story arcs, well-drawn characters who change and grow, murders, action, revenge, pathos, more humor, quotable & memorable dialog, suspense, multiple romantic story lines... everything. Characters are likable but complex. Locations and plots are varied and interesting. Never a dull episode, and unlike many series, the final episodes offer a satisfying conclusion. My family and I have watched the entire series together three times, it's that good.
                This shows is master class in acting.

                Robin Tunney and Simon Baker have a chemistry and credibility so rare that it's simply wonderful to watch every single scene. These are two of the greatest actors I've ever watched. I wish they won more awards and received greater recognition.

                With the character development in the series, the writers were on point. Jane and Lisbon are mature characters; credible, solid, exceptionally developed in all aspects. Because of the subtlety of the writing and nuanced performances, their arc over the 7 seasons is just sublime.

                Humour and darkness are perfectly balanced and refined in both the writing and performances. It doesn't talk down to its viewers. It doesn't go in for shallow drama to create tension. It's inventive. All is purposefully done. That I deeply respect.

                Cho, Rigsby and Van Pelt really become a truly lovable team and they somehow create a sense of home. Tim Kang, Amanda Righetti and Owain Yeoman were perfect at every turn. Very rare. I missed the team so much. That's a testament to the actors.

                Exquisite guest stars mean this show is rife with the most memorable, bizarre and irreplaceable characters. There are too many to name. It would clog the word count. I mean. Monster talent. All in one show. Every single person created a memorable and an immensely enjoyable character. I wanted to see more of them.

                I remember at the time it aired, people were going mad speculating about Red John. He was an excellent catalyst - a truly horrific storyline and figure.

                But to me the show was never truly about him. It was about Jane, Lisbon and the team. Finding your people and purpose. Growing and learning from pain.

                I love the music by Blake Neely. Psychological, eerie, haunting, funny, emotional, heartwarming, reflective, sentimental... He aced it. I revisit it constantly.

                Bruno Heller and Chris Long created something incredible. The fact they honoured what the fans wanted in Season 6 and 7 is a tremendously rare outcome in this business and unlike any show I've ever seen. They truly nailed it.

                I miss this show and characters and always will.For anyone who thinks this is close to Psych...you're dead wrong. While both shows take a similar premise, they're so different in many ways. This show does have a man with the ability to spot minute details, but he does so much more, he plays mind games with people, reads their emotions and sets elaborate traps to catch them. Many compare him to Shawn Spencer of Psych, but I would rather compare him to Sherlock Holmes, except more tortured. The pilot obviously takes on a more serious approach than Psych and the dynamics of the show go from cute and funny to deeply disturbing in seconds.

                It takes your one crime per episode procedural drama with a gifted detective and takes it one step further. Patrick Jane is more self effacing, gets into trouble and is a known fraud. But he isn't mean or intentionally rubs people the wrong way like House(also based on Holmes) or Spencer. He is very soothing, warm, instills trust and seems to get along with people pretty well, from the guy who did it to his team. At the same time, he does like to flex his intellect and power over people and loves to play games to get answers (and yet, so charming when he does so). So it's kind of disarming when you begin to see there are some serious issues with this character, he doesn't sleep, doesn't believe in life after death (and is happy that way), and is actually anti-social with the group. There are further reasons as to his psychosis that won't be discussed. Behind those warm baby blues, warm smile and calming presence, there is a man being crushed to death by very weighty issues.

                Patrick Jane is a fantastic character, he's obviously brilliant, but a little distant and isn't fond of working with others. As a former faux psychic he seems pretty ready to disable believers. And of course, Simon Baker is a brilliant actor and is the reason I tuned in (I admit I too feared this was a Psych ripoff) and he brings so much depth to this character. When he plays his mind games he always brings a sense of "I know more than you and there is nothing you can do about it." type of amusement and when Red John or death apparates in conversation you see a distant look in his eyes that conveys more than what he actually saying (the psychiatry appointment in the pilot was incredible). He really plays off the layers of Patrick Jane well, pulling some back and when we get a true glimpse, the layers fall back in place. And credit goes to the set-up of Red John as his "nemesis" through a copy cat. He and Jane have a very tense meet up awaiting them, but I can wait for that just to experience the chase and the unraveling history between these two.

                Another credit would go to the incredible Robin Tunney (of The Craft and Empire Records) who was reason number two for watching the pilot. She has had very little to work with in the first two episodes (but her role grew from 1 to 2 so I have faith), but she plays the hard nosed detective with a little more prudishness and distance than I would have expected. How much she knows about Jane and how far they go back is a mystery to me and their dynamic is interesting. She doesn't fall into stereotype and has retained a beguiling sense of mystery. I also appreciate the lack of clichéd moments "fraught with sexual tension" between Lisbon and Jane.

                And I'd also like to credit Tim Kang- a lovely surprise and I enjoyed his character who really doesn't give a crap about hurting people's feelings or stepping on toes, he just wants to solve the case. Love it and kudos.

                My only complaint would be explained in the two above paragraphs briefly. I love Cho and Lisbon and hope to get see more of the team (Van Pelt and Rigsby are really cute as well), but I understand this is called "The Mentalist" and there is still time to slowly introduce Jane's history with the team and more in depth coverage of these characters. I've only seen two episodes and I think what I anticipate will come into fruition.

                Overall, this show is well written, well acted, and beautifully shot. I for one have set up a season recording on my DVR and cannot wait for the next episode, yes you can consider me a fan and I hope you head over to CBS.com and give this show a chance. I wish I had more stars to give.

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The PlayStation 5 (PS5) is a home video game console developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment. Announced in 2019 as the successor to the PlayStation 4, the PS5 was released on November 12, 2020 in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, North America, Singapore and South Korea, and November 19, 2020 onwards in other major markets except China. The console is scheduled to be launched in India on February 2, 2021.[1]

                The platform was launched in two variants: a base model with an Ultra HD Blu-ray-compatible optical disc drive, and a Digital Edition lacking this drive, serving as a lower-cost model for those who prefer to buy games through digital download.

                The PlayStation 5's main features include a solid-state drive customized for high-speed data streaming to enable significant improvements in storage performance, an AMD GPU capable of 4K resolution display at up to 120 frames per second, hardware-accelerated ray tracing for realistic lighting and reflections, the Tempest Engine allowing for hardware-accelerated 3D audio effects, and backward compatibility with most PlayStation 4 and PlayStation VR games.(Paragraph by Wikipedia)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5).</p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Nokia Corporation (natively Nokia Oyj, referred to as Nokia; Finnish: [ˈnokiɑ], UK: /ˈnɒkiə/, US: /ˈnoʊkiə/) is a Finnish multinational telecommunications, information technology, and consumer electronics company, founded in 1865. Nokia's headquarters are in Espoo, Finland, in the greater Helsinki metropolitan area.[4] In 2018, Nokia employed approximately 103,000 people across over 100 countries, did business in more than 130 countries, and reported annual revenues of around €23 billion.[5] Nokia is a public limited company listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[6] It is the world's 415th-largest company measured by 2016 revenues according to the Fortune Global 500, having peaked at 85th place in 2009.[7] It is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[8][9]

                The company has operated in various industries over the past 150 years. It was founded as a pulp mill and had long been associated with rubber and cables, but since the 1990s has focused on large-scale telecommunications infrastructure, technology development, and licensing.[10] Nokia is a major contributor to the mobile telephony industry, having assisted in the development of the GSM, 3G, and LTE standards (and currently in 5G), and was once the largest worldwide vendor of mobile phones and smartphones. After a partnership with Microsoft and Nokia's subsequent market struggles,[11][12][13] Microsoft bought its mobile phone business,[14][15] creating Microsoft Mobile as its successor in 2014.[16] After the sale, Nokia began to focus more on its telecommunications infrastructure business and on Internet of things technologies, marked by the divestiture of its Here mapping division and the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent, including its Bell Labs research organization.[17] The company then also experimented with virtual reality and digital health, the latter through the purchase of Withings.[18][19][20][21] The Nokia brand returned to the mobile and smartphone market in 2016 through a licensing arrangement with HMD Global.[22] Nokia continues to be a major patent licensor for most large mobile phone vendors.[23] As of 2018, Nokia is the world's third-largest network equipment manufacturer.[24]

                The company was viewed with national pride by Finns, as its mobile phone business made it by far the largest worldwide company and brand from Finland.[25] At its peak in 2000, during the telecoms bubble, Nokia accounted for 4% of the country's GDP, 21% of total exports, and 70% of the Helsinki Stock Exchange market capital.[26][27](Paragraph by Wikeipedia)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia)</p>
